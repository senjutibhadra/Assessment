## TITLE: Accessibility Implementation  

**Component:** Frontend  

### Description  
Our website is still lacking WCAG 2.1 compliance for the Forms page.  

We use the [WAVE extension](https://wave.webaim.org/) to ensure accessibility works across all screen readers.  

### Technical Requirements  
- Add accessibility enhancements to the `/FormPage` page  
- Use the WAVE extension to verify compliance with WCAG 2.1 rules  
- Reference other pages for consistency  

### Acceptance Criteria  
✅ The application is fully navigable by keyboard  
✅ All interactive elements are accessible via screen readers like NVDA.  
✅ Color contrast meets WCAG standards 

#### Note
There seem to be some styling and responsiveness issues in the form. If you notice any misalignment, layout problems, or unexpected behavior, address them and document the changes.
